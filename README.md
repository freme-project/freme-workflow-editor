# FREME Workflow Editor

This repository is deprecated and not maintained any longer.

This project works as a demonstration of what the FREME services can do.
Its goal is to hide NIF from the user and show the capabilities of FREME.
Focus lies on simplicity, so that the user will not have to work his way around
begin/endIndices and annotations.

The service works by sending requests to the specified `fremeApi`, then parsing the
produced NIF (by using the [rdfQuery](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rdfquery/) library).
The annotations in the RDF graph are then grouped by their offsets and added as graphic tooltips to the input text.
